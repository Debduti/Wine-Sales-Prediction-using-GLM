# Objective
In this project, our aim is to analyze the Wine dataset and build a model to predict the number
of wine cases sold, based on its features, most of which are chemical properties. This dataset
comes from a Kaggle competition for wine sales prediction and the dataset can be found on
Github. We will cover the following topics in this project:
a. We will do an initial analysis to find out nulls in the dataset and process them
b. We will do exploratory analysis on all the variables and produce relevant boxplots,
scatter plots and histograms
c. We will then do some feature engineering that will help with building our models
d. We will build four different models- Poisson Regression Model, Negative Binomial
Model, Zero Inflated Poisson Model and Zero Inflated Negative Binomial Model. We
will compare their performances based on metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error,
Mean Absolute Error, AIC and BIC and select a final best model
